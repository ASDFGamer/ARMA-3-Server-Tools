# ARMA-3-Server-Tools
This should be some small tools that help while managing a ARMA 3 Server.

I think some of this should work for example the PBO Extraction function, but i think that not everything works. But I wrote this a few years ago and have now no clue anymore how ARMA Servers work, so i can't test it.

INFO: This needs the dependency org.asdfgamer.hilfreich from https://github.com/ASDFGamer/Java_Hilfreich which isn't on the maven repository and has to be installed into the local repo (mvn install)
